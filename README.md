# Springboot-3-Microservices-Application
<p>Created microserviec application having two services department and employee.
Here I have created API gateway which is the entry point for request from user, service registery where all the microservices and its instances are registered, Zipking for loggingand tracing, Eureka config server where configuration for all the microservices are stored.</p>

- Developed a microservices-based application using Spring Boot, implementing modular Department and Employee services with robust inter-service communication.
- Integrated Eureka for service discovery and Config Server for centralized configuration, enabling scalable and manageable microservices architecture.
- Enhanced observability with Zipkin distributed tracing and secured external API access through an API Gateway, ensuring reliable performance and seamless client interactions.
